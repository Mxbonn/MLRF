L5~a;3}$~S,How does the convolutional module in MobileNetV2 reduce the memory footprint?,By only having large tensors in an intermediate state.,MobileNetV2: Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks,https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381,"Large tensors are only used inside the inverted residual with linear bottleneck. Therefore they don't need to be stored in main memory, as would be the case in a module where the large tensors are used in for example a residual connection.",
