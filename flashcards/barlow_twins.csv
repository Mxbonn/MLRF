This decorrelation reduces the redundancy between output units, so that the output units contain&nbsp;non-redundant information about the sample.",

This causes the embedding&nbsp;vectors of distorted versions of a sample to be similar, while minimizing the redundancy between the components of these vectors.",Barlow Twins: Self-Supervised Learning via Redundancy Reduction,https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03230,,
