b@Cs+0H!}4,Which aspects of <b>NeRF</b> does <b>instant-ngp</b> improve?,"1. <b>Rendering algorithm</b>: They <b>accelerate the ray sampling</b> by skipping over the empty space and stopping after enough density has been reached, this is done using <i>occupancy grids</i>.<br>2. <b>Small neural network</b>: NeRFs only require small neural networks, by <b>implementing them in a single cuda kernel</b> they improve 10x over PyTorch/Tensorflow. (<a href=""https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn"">https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn</a>)<br>3. A&nbsp;<b>faster input encoder</b>: They introduce a <b>multi-resolution hash encoding</b> to encode the neural network inputs in a faster and more accurate manner. This is the main contribution of the paper.",Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding,https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05989,,

cQQ{UE2~tB,How are <b>hash collisions</b> handled in the <i>multiresolution hash encoding of instant-ngp</i>?,There is <b>no collision handling</b>.<br>They rely on the neural network to be robust against hash collision. One reason this works is because the coarsers levels fit in the hashtable and have no collisions and the higher resolutions are statistically unlikely to have collisions simultaneously at many levels.,Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding,https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05989,,
