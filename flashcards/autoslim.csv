Start from a standard Network (e.g. Mobilenet).</div><div>2. Train a universal slimmable model for 10-20% of the full training epochs.</div><div>3. Start with the largest model (e.g. \(1.0 \times\) or \(1.5 \times\)) and compare the network accuracy among the possibilities where each layer is slimmed by one channel group. Then greedily slim the layer with minimal accuracy drop. Stop when reaching the constraint.</div><div>4.
