OEM$imd*-E,What is <b>Anchor pruning</b>&nbsp;in the context of object detection?,"Anchor pruning is <b>a pruning technique for object detection</b>, which removes redundant anchors in the detection head.",Anchor Pruning for Object Detection,https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00432,,
BiGsET<1}2,How does <b>Anchor Pruning</b> work?,"Anchor Pruning <b>starts from a fully trained model</b>.<div>Using a search algorithm, the search space of possible anchor configurations is explored efficiently.</div><div>The result of the search algorithm is <b>a set of anchor configurations that are Pareto-efficient</b>.</div><div>After selecting a Pareto-optimal anchor configuration, <b>the accuracy can be improved by training this configuration again from scratch.</b></div>",Anchor Pruning for Object Detection,https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00432,,
"H@Q]v(c|Z,",Why does <b>Anchor pruning</b> have larger impact on the running time of object detection models than just the FLOPS reduction?,"The running time of an object detection model in an embedded context is <b>often dominated by the&nbsp;running time of the post processing steps</b>, which is <b>directly related to the number of bounding boxes</b> that are produced by the network. This post-processing step is however not included in the FLOPS count.",Anchor Pruning for Object Detection,https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00432,,
D={>vr/o#%,What is an <b>Overanchorized </b>network?,It is as an object detection model that has more anchors than strictly needed.,Anchor Pruning for Object Detection,https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00432,"An <b>Overanchorized</b>&nbsp;network can be used as base model to start <b>anchor pruning</b>&nbsp;from, this avoids having to experiment with many different anchor shape initializations.",
d0:e[[Vlat,When is an object detection <b>anchor redundant</b>?,An anchor is redundant when it produces bounding boxes that are (almost) completely covered by predictions of neighboring anchors.,Anchor Pruning for Object Detection,https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00432,"The distribution of bounding boxes produces by different anchors shows that for certain anchors, many of the predictions can also be produced by neighboring anchors.<div><img src=""paste-29cb9f63c29359137bcc9ec0955143062da12061.jpg""><br></div>",
r`cf9VN23L,What is an <b>anchor-based</b>&nbsp;object detector?,"Anchor-based detectors associate some predefined anchors to each feature layer to which the detection head is attached. Usually, the anchors are defined in terms of size and aspect ratio. <b>The classifier and regressor in the detection head output the class scores and the 4 offsets relative to&nbsp;the predefined anchor shape for each pixel in a feature map.</b>",Anchor Pruning for Object Detection,https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00432,"<img src=""https://nl.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/ssd_detection.png""><div>Anchor boxes are associated with each pixel in every feature map.</div><div>The final bounding box predictions are made as classification predictions + offset predictions from the anchor.</div>",
