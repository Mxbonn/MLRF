u2~sQ~EtPb,Give the formula for the <b>Triplet Loss</b>.,"\[\mathcal{L}_\text{triplet}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^+, \mathbf{x}^-) = \sum_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}} \max\big( 0, \|f(\mathbf{x}) - f(\mathbf{x}^+)\|^2_2 - \|f(\mathbf{x}) - f(\mathbf{x}^-)\|^2_2 + \alpha \big)\]<br>where \(\mathbf{x}\)&nbsp;is the an anchor input (e.g. an image of a specific person), \(\mathbf{x}^+\) is a positive sample (meaning that it belongs to the same class as \(\mathbf{x}\)) and \(\mathbf{x}^-\) is a negative sample (i.e. from a different class).<br>\(\alpha\) is a margin that is enforced between positive and negative pairs.",FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering,https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832,"<img src=""triplet-loss.png""><br>Illustration: The Triplet Loss minimizes the distance between an <i>anchor</i> and a <i>positive</i>, both of which have the same identity, and&nbsp;maximizes the distance between the <i>anchor</i> and a <i>negative</i> of a&nbsp;different identity.",
t=hxxrzgly,What is an important <b>limitation</b> of the <b>triplet loss</b> function?,"It requires <b>large batches in the order of a few thousand examples</b>.<br>In order to have meaningful positive and negative paris, a minimal samples of each class need to be present in each batch.",FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering,https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832,,
*0?.?#HKX,"In <b>triplet loss</b>, how are the anchor \(\mathbf{x}\), positive \(\mathbf{x}^+\) and negative \(\mathbf{x}^-\) triplets selected?","Using large batches,<b> all anchor-positive pairs</b> are selected.<br><b>Negatives</b> are selected such that \(\|f(\mathbf{x}) - f(\mathbf{x}^+)\|^2_2 &lt; \|f(\mathbf{x}) - f(\mathbf{x}^-)\|^2_2 \). These negatives are called <i>semi-hard</i>.",FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering,https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832,,
